# RustyNES

A NES Emulator written using Rust

## Summary

RustyNES is an emulator for NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) written with Rust.

It is developed in `#[no_std]` Environment. So, you can build in various environments to implement `Hardware` trait.

This Project is still work-in-progress, but doesn't implement "ALL" features of NES. I don't recommand to use it for playing NES games.

## Getting Started

If you want to run the example, you can just run this code.

```
cargo run --example pc [path-to-rom]
